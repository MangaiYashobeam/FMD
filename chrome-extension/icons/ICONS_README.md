# Icon Placeholders

Place your extension icons here:

- **icon16.png** - 16x16px (toolbar icon)
- **icon48.png** - 48x48px (extension management)
- **icon128.png** - 128x128px (Chrome Web Store)

## Temporary Solution

Until you have custom icons, you can:

1. Create simple PNG icons using any image editor
2. Use a logo generator like:
   - https://www.favicon-generator.org/
   - https://realfavicongenerator.net/
3. Export in the required sizes

## Design Suggestions

- Use your brand colors (purple gradient from popup)
- Include a car icon 🚗
- Keep it simple and recognizable
- Ensure good contrast for visibility

For now, the extension will work without icons, but Chrome will show a default placeholder.
